Project Description:
We were interested in investigating gun violence in aggregate across the United States, as the issue is important and relevant, but often discussed on a case-by-case basis rather than holistically. The data standardizes incident reports including information related to the types of guns used, people involved, and locations incidents occur. Some of what we discovered was that certain cities like Chicago have significantly more gun violence than other cities, handguns pose more of a problem than assualt rifles with regards to the number of people killed, and that some seasons are more deadly than others.
